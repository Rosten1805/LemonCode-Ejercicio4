                        to import them and some unique editing options. There's also a couple of tips and tricks that make designing with images in 
                        Figma easy. So whether you're new and coming from another tool, or just looking to improve your workflow, this guide is sure 
                        to make your colleagues and hovering art directors go, "Wait...how'd you do that?!"
